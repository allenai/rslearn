`train_cities.geojson` and `val_cities.geojson` are derived from the
[SimpleMaps World Cities Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)
by taking the 2,000 most populous cities and randomly assigning 1,000 of those cities
to each of train and val. See `simplemaps_license.txt` for license and attribution.
