[Back to DatasetConfig.md](../DatasetConfig.md)

The tile store stores ingested raster and vector data so that they can be efficiently
re-projected and cropped to align with windows during materialization. See
[CoreConcepts](../CoreConcepts.md) for a summary of the prepare, ingest, and materialize
stages.

This document is TODO. See `rslearn.tile_stores.default` for available configuration
options.
